@unpublished{dang2015ignorance,
	Abstract = {Debt is optimal for trading, and the optimal collateral backing that debt is also debt. Debt as collateral transfers the most value intertemporally. When that debt is used as collateral for another debt contract, the "debt-on-debt" preserves symmetric ignorance because it minimizes the incentive to produce private information about the payoffs, so debt is least information-sensitive, i.e., liquid. But, bad public news (a shock) about the value of the collateral that backs the debt can cause information- insensitive debt to become information-sensitive. To prevent endogenous adverse selection agents reduce the amount of trade below the expected value of the debt collateral. The shock is amplified, a financial crisis.},
